//40 is the final reward era, almost all tokens minted

Hello, I'm the developer.  As far as anything is concerned technically it's a decentralized token so I shouldnt be the 'controller' just like vitalik should be the dictator of ethereum -- and he isn't :D everyone owns 0xbitcoin just as much as I do 
For sure. Okay thanks 
Cool! Yes I wish I could find the quote of vitalik telling creators of other coins that be could literally create their coin within ethereum - well he was right and now bitcoins been done (about as faithfully as it can get) 
Ethereum will dominate 
Ooo 
The difficulty will double sooon 
No there's no kill function 
It's not hard to code a GPU miner 
I wrote up a roadmap 
Oooo I'm on Linux 
Ooo how do I reproduce 
Oh that's a fantastic idea 
websockets 
its a big ol nodejs app 
somebody should make a gambling/game dapp where it uses 0xbitcoin instead of ether 
0xBitcoin is directly competing against Ether as a decentralized payment mechanism on Ethereum. The Ether team wants tokens like 0xBitcoin to be better currency and Ether.   
0xbitcoin has essentially the same form and function and shape as Bitcoin 
0xbitcoin is 'pure' and actually completely unenforceable by governments - unlike 99 percent of tokens it's invulnerable as it's endpoints are decentralized and itself is decentralized 
Every coin has people who are for it and those who are against it. I will tell that to a lawyer. Bitcoin is traded on an exchange and its a commodity. Read about the Howie test. There are no investors into any organization therefore it cannot be a security. In fact, there is no organization behind 0xBitcoin at all. There is nobody to talk to a lawyer. Nobody 'controls' or 'has authority' over 0xBitcoin. There is no com 
Maybe lol.  Basically one of 0xbitcoins advantages vs Bitcoin is that it can be traded on decentralized exchanges  
Also... I see 0xbitcoin as the best candidate for the first token that Coinbase adds 
But the reasoning is sound.  0xbitcoin is the first decentralized token and the token most similar to a commodity 
Then when humanity invented Erc20 tokens we regressed and went back to a centralized silo control model for the tokens until 2018 when 0xbitcoin was invented, showing everyone how you can keep tokens decentralized 
I should make a 0xbitcoin sticker store 
0xBitcoin runs on Ethereum 
Yes 0xbitcoin is attempting to emulate the true Bitcoin philosophy and culture.  Not be a fake/cheap knockoff like the other tokens.  Furthermore this means that it has to be inherently trustless.  You do not have to trust me at all.  
0xbitcoin is upgraded by building smart contracts that do stuff with it
